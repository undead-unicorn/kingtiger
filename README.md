# How To Install
Make sure you have a mod folder- it can have any name- and a .mod file in your Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod directory.

Drop the contents of this git INTO the mod folder

Make sure the .mod file has the following details:

version="1.9.*"

tags={

	"Alternative History"
	"National Focuses"
	"Graphics"
	"Ideologies"
	"Map"
	"Collin Joe"
	"King Tiger"
	"Meme"
	"Funny"
	
}

name="King Tiger Mod"

picture="thumbnail.jpg"

supported_version="1.9.*"

path="C:/Users/jewnicorn/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/King Tiger Mod"

make sure the directory stated in the .mod file leads to the KING TIGER MOD FOLDER----- not the hoi4 mod folder, but the folder in which you dropped the contents of the git into! Obviously your directory will be different to mine!

Also, make sure the slashes are forward slashes: / NOT back slashes: \
